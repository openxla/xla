// A BufferSequencingEvent keeps track of dependencies of a buffer on each
// stream it has been used on.
//
// Each logical buffer in an XLA computation may be defined (i.e., written to)
// at most once. We call the operation that writes the buffer's value on some
// stream (e.g., a transfer or compute kernel) the buffer's definition event.
//
// After the operation that populates the value of a buffer has been enqueued on
// 'stream', SetSequencingEvent() should also be called to trigger the
// definition event after the operation has completed.
//
// After the buffer is read on 'stream' another event should be added so that
// it is possible to sequence buffer donation after all reads have completed.
//
// Since different streams are not necessarily synchronized with one another,
// if we wish to consume the value of the buffer on a different stream, we
// should first call WaitForEventOnStream(stream), which add a cross-stream
// from 'stream' to the buffer's definition event, causing 'stream' to pause
// until the definition event has been triggered, if needed. Operations on
// 'stream' may then assume that the buffer is valid and its contents correspond
// to the desired buffer.
//
// The dependency logic caches the set of streams at the tail of which the
// definition event is known to have occurred; waiting for the same event on the
// same stream causes no additional waiting.
