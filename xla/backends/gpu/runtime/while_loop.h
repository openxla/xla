// A library that supports running while loops in the XLA:GPU runtime.
//
// See StableHLO documentation for the while loop semantics:
// https://openxla.org/stablehlo/spec#while
//
// This library supports both Thunks and Commands. When a while loop executes
// thunks (via the WhileThunk), some of the nested thunks might depend on the
// loop induction variable, which is typically available in device memory.
// However, having to copy it back to host every time is very expensive.
// Instead, we keep track of the current loop iteration in a thread local
// variable, and each individual thunk (e.g., dynamic slices) can access it
// without having to synchronize with device activity. Each individual thunk is
// responsible for computing the loop induction variable from the iteration
// number.
//
// At compile time, XLA:GPU can choose to unroll the while loop, which later
// enables command buffer thunk passes to form much larger command buffers and
// launch the whole loop as one command. However, when we execute unrolled
// thunks (or record commands for them), we still need to know in which loop
// iteration a thunk or command is executing, and we rely on thread local
// storage and metadata-only thunks/commands to keep the state in thread local
// storage. Essentially we keep a thread local stack of `WhileLoopState` entries
// for all runtime loops.
//
// Example:
//
//   1. WhileThunk(cond, body); name="while.0", trip_count=2
//
// Thunk sequence after unrolling:
//
//   1. WhileEnterThunk: name="while.0", trip_count=2
//   2. SequentialThunk(cond)
//   3. SequentialThunk(body)
//   4. WhileIncrementThunk
//   5. SequentialThunk(cond)
//   6. SequentialThunk(body)
//   7. WhileExitThunk
//
// Thunks corresponding to loop Enter/Exit push/pop while loop state onto the
// thread local stack, and between every repetition of cond/body thunk
// sequences, we increment the loop iteration counter.
//
// When we record commands, we have similar metadata-only commands that update
// the thread local while loop state, so each individual command has access to
// the correct loop iteration number.

// State of a while loop execution tracked by the XLA:GPU runtime.
