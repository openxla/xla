"""NCCL (pronounced "Nickel") is a multi-GPU collective communications library that provides routines such as all-gather, all-reduce, broadcast, reduce, reduce-scatter, as well as point-to-point send and receive that are optimized to achieve high bandwidth and low latency over PCIe and NVLink high-speed interconnects within a node and over InfiniBand or TCP/IP sockets across nodes."""
