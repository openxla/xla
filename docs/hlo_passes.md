# HLO Passes 

This document outlines the [HLO](https://openxla.org/xla/terminology) optimizations and transformations passes in the [XLA compiler](https://openxla.org/xla/architecture). 

## Introduction

A single HLO Pass can be comprised of one or many compiler optimizations and transformations, and XLA provides several hundred such passes. HLO focuses only on the shape (e.g. a 3x4 matrix) and the [operation semantics](https://openxla.org/xla/operation_semantics) of the arrays to make the optimization or transformation easier.

For example:

* [`AlgebraicSimplifier`:](https://github.com/openxla/xla/blob/c37fc6a383b870f43cef82280418fcefcc90b0f8/xla/hlo/transforms/simplifiers/algebraic_simplifier.h#L417) A pass that performs a number of mostly arithmetic simplifications and optimizations. Including: 
  * When dividing by a constant, an optimization is performed to transform the operation to multiplication by the inversion of the constant. 
  
* [`HloRematerialization`:](https://github.com/openxla/xla/tree/main/xla/hlo/transforms/simplifiers/hlo_rematerialization.h) A pass that recomputes selected expressions in the computation to reduce memory pressure caused by long live ranges of array-shaped values. 

## Developer details

The base class for HLO passes can be found in [`xla/hlo/pass/hlo_pass_interface.h`](https://github.com/openxla/xla/blob/main/xla/hlo/pass/hlo_pass_interface.h). HLO pass should not extend this class directly but instead should extend [`HloModulePass`](https://github.com/openxla/xla/blob/main/xla/hlo/pass/hlo_pass_interface.h#L142) or [`HloModuleGroupPass`](https://github.com/openxla/xla/blob/main/xla/hlo/pass/hlo_pass_interface.h#L172).

See also [XLA HLO Pass Framework](https://github.com/openxla/xla/tree/main/xla/hlo/pass#readme).

### Tooling and Testing

XLA comes with multiple command line tools, including the hlo-opt tool. This tool allows execution of an individual pass independent of the given platform compilation stages. For more information see [Tooling](https://openxla.org/xla/tools#hlo-opt_hlo_pass_development_and_debugging).

For information on writing unit tests for HLO Passes see [Testing HLO Passes](https://openxla.org/xla/test_hlo_passes).

## Hardware-independent HLO Passes

Hardware-independent passes are shared across the XLA backend. Some passes may be specialized for specific backends, but the high-level functionality is similar.

Shared passes or hardware-independent passes can be found in [`xla/hlo/transforms`](https://github.com/openxla/xla/tree/main/xla/hlo/transforms).

### Hardware-independent HLO Pass Examples

The following are examples of shared passes or hardware-independent passes.

#### Rematerialization 

See also [`HloRematerialization`](https://github.com/openxla/xla/blob/main/xla/hlo/transforms/simplifiers/hlo_rematerialization.h).

Selectively recomputes expressions within the HLO graph to reduce memory usage. Trades off higher compute for lower memory usage. Can reduce memory usage by tens of percent and is required to run many large models.

#### Algebraic Simplifier 

See also [`AlgebraicSimplifier`](https://github.com/openxla/xla/blob/main/xla/hlo/transforms/simplifiers/algebraic_simplifier.h).

A grab bag of simplifications, optimizations, and canonicalizations. Analogous to [LLVMâ€™s `instcombine` pass](https://llvm.org/docs/Passes.html#instcombine-combine-redundant-instructions).

#### Constant Folding 

See also [`HloConstantFolding`](https://github.com/openxla/xla/blob/main/xla/hlo/transforms/simplifiers/hlo_constant_folding.h).

Replaces expressions which can be evaluated at compile time with their constant equivalent. 

#### Dead Code Elimination 

See also [`HloDCE`](https://github.com/openxla/xla/blob/main/xla/hlo/transforms/simplifiers/hlo_dce.h) .

Removes operations with unused results (fast implementation). 

#### Call Graph Flattening 

See also [`FlattenCallGraph`](https://github.com/openxla/xla/blob/main/xla/hlo/transforms/simplifiers/flatten_call_graph.h).

A legalization pass which converts the HLO call graph into a tree by cloning computations. Required because memory is statically assigned to HLO operations and not based on dynamic call context.

#### Reshape Mover 

See also [`ReshapeMover`](https://github.com/openxla/xla/blob/main/xla/hlo/transforms/simplifiers/reshape_mover.h).

Reshapes and transposes can be expensive. This pass moves and reshapes and transposes across elementwise operations enabling the operations to be merged or eliminated.

#### Zero-sized HLO Elimination

See also [`ZeroSizedHloElimination`](https://github.com/openxla/xla/blob/main/xla/hlo/transforms/simplifiers/zero_sized_hlo_elimination.h).

HLO supports arrays of zero size (one or more dimensions has a bound of zero). This pass simplifies the graph by replacing zero-sized operations with zero-sized constants.

## GPU-specific HLO Passes

Passes specific to the GPU backend are found in [`xla/service/gpu`](https://github.com/openxla/xla/tree/main/xla/service/gpu). These passes can be identified as classes defined in `namespace gpu`. 

### GPU-specific HLO Pass Example

The following is an example of a GPU-specific pass.

#### cuDNN Rewriter 

See also [`CudnnFusedConvRewriter`](https://github.com/openxla/xla/blob/main/xla/service/gpu/transforms/cudnn_fused_conv_rewriter.h) and [`CudnnNormRewriter`](https://github.com/openxla/xla/blob/main/xla/service/gpu/transforms/cudnn_norm_rewriter.h).

Rewrites fused convolution and norm operations into their respective library calls in cuDNN.

## CPU-specific HLO Passes 

Passes specific to the CPU backend are found in [`xla/service/cpu`](https://github.com/openxla/xla/tree/main/xla/service/cpu). These passes can be identified as classes defined in `namespace cpu`.

### CPU-specific HLO Pass Examples

The following are examples of CPU-specific passes.

#### Convolution Canonicalization

See also [`ConvCanonicalization`](https://github.com/openxla/xla/blob/main/xla/service/cpu/conv_canonicalization.h).

Canonicalizes convolutions so that they can be lowered to a fast implementation in Eigen.

#### Operation Parallelization

See also [`ParallelTaskAssigner`](https://github.com/openxla/xla/blob/main/xla/service/cpu/parallel_task_assignment.h).

Partitions HLOs into tasks to run on separate threads.

## Analysis Passes

Analysis passes are not considered "HLO passes" since they do not transform HLO and may not extend `HloModulePass` or `HloModuleGroupPass`. Shared analyses are found in [`xla/hlo/analysis`](https://github.com/openxla/xla/tree/main/xla/hlo/analysis).

### Analysis Pass Examples

The following are examples of Analysis passes.

#### Dataflow Analysis

See also [`HloDataflowAnalysis`](https://github.com/openxla/xla/tree/main/xla/hlo/analysis/hlo_dataflow_analysis.h).

Identifies all HLO values in the graph and their uses.

#### Alias Analysis

See also [`HloAliasAnalysis`](https://github.com/openxla/xla/tree/main/xla/hlo/analysis/hlo_alias_analysis.h).

Identifies must-alias relationships between values in the program.

#### Computation Cost Analysis

See also [`HloCostAnalysis`](https://github.com/openxla/xla/tree/main/xla/service/hlo_cost_analysis.h).

Computes FLOP count and memory usage for all operations in the program.

#### HLO Verification

See also [`HloVerifier`](https://github.com/openxla/xla/tree/main/xla/service/hlo_verifier.h).

Verifies various invariants of the HLO graph.
