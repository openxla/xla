# GPU BFC growth in a reserved virtual arena

Preallocated spatial GPU BFC pools grow by default when using device memory.
The memory fraction or absolute size determines the initial physical
allocation. If that much memory is not available, the initial region shrinks
like a fixed pool does, with a warning, and the collective (lower-end) limit is
whatever was obtained. The growth cap is a fraction of total device memory (all
of it by default), rounded down to the mapping granularity.
Reserving this capacity does not allocate physical memory or guarantee that
growth will succeed. Non-spatial pools, unified memory, and other allocator
kinds retain their existing behavior.

## Configuration

One setting describes both the initial allocation and the growth cap. It is
spelled as `START` or `START-CAP`, fractions of total device memory, and parsed
into a typed `MemFraction` (`FlexMemFraction` or `FixedMemFraction`) that is
passed through to allocator construction:

| String      | Parsed policy                  | Behavior                                                             |
|-------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `0.75`      | `FlexMemFraction{0.75, 1.0}`   | Today's default and every existing script: preallocate 75%, grow to all device memory. |
| `0.75-0.85` | `FlexMemFraction{0.75, 0.85}`  | Preallocate 75%, grow to at most 85%; leaves headroom for other CUDA users. |
| `0.75-0.75` | `FixedMemFraction{0.75}`       | Hard cap, the pre-growth semantics; the pool never grows.            |
| `0.5-1.0`   | `FlexMemFraction{0.5, 1.0}`    | Small start, full growth.                                            |

A bare fraction at or above 1 is fixed (there is nothing to grow into; values
above 1 only make sense with unified memory). The cap must be at least the start
and a growth cap cannot exceed 1.

Where the string is accepted:

- `XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_MEM_FRACTION` in JAX, forwarded as the PJRT C API create
  option `memory_fraction_policy` (string). The older float option
  `memory_fraction` still works and means a bare fraction.
- `--xla_gpu_memory_fraction_policy` in `XLA_FLAGS`, which overrides the
  client's setting for the BFC allocator and works without any JAX change.
- `GpuAllocatorConfig::memory_fraction` for C++ clients; `ParseMemFraction`
  converts the string form.

The initial allocation (the start fraction, or `gpu_system_memory_size` when
set) must fit under the cap or client creation fails with `InvalidArgument`.
Once a pool reaches its cap, allocation reverts to the usual retry and OOM path.
`--xla_gpu_enable_nccl_user_buffers_in_default_space` pins a growable policy to
`FixedMemFraction{start}` with a warning, because automatic registration needs a
fixed, fully registered arena. Allocator kinds other than the BFC pool use only
the start fraction.

## Virtual reservation and physical backing

On CUDA, the existing `DeviceMemAllocator` reserves one VA range for the cap
before BFC's first allocation. `CudaMemoryReservation::Create` calls
`cuMemAddressReserve`; the entire range is initially unmapped. BFC first asks for
the configured preallocation size, rounded up to the mapping granularity.
`CudaRawMemoryAllocation::Create` obtains physical memory with `cuMemCreate`.
`MemoryReservation::MapTo` maps it at the reservation base with `cuMemMap`, then
grants access to the local device and P2P-capable peers with `cuMemSetAccess`.
The rest of the reservation stays unmapped and consumes no GPU physical memory.

An S(0) allocation first tries its owned holes and the central gap. On a miss,
BFC calls its existing `Extend` path, using normal growth sizing and backpedaling.
`DeviceMemAllocator` allocates additional physical backing and maps it immediately
after the mapped prefix. It never unmaps or moves existing backing. Only after
mapping and access setup succeed does it publish the new address and byte count
to BFC. Failure releases only the new backing (and unmaps the new slice if access
setup failed); the existing prefix and BFC accounting remain unchanged.

```text
                     fixed S(1) limit P                  VA cap C
Initial: | S(1) -> | gap | <- S(0) |....... unmapped ...........|
Growth:  | S(1) -> | gap | <- S(0) |  more S(0)  |.. unmapped ..|
         ^ base never moves                    ^ mapped end M
```

The three limits are distinct: reserved capacity C, physically mapped capacity
M, and the initial collective allocation limit P. Growth advances M, up to C;
it never changes P or the reservation base. A physical allocation may fail below
C if cuDNN, NCCL, another process, or other users consume available device memory.

## BFC region extension and collective safety

In reserved mode, `DeviceMemAllocator::SupportsCoalescing()` is true and each
successful extension is adjacent to the preceding prefix. BFC's existing
`RegionManager::AddOrExtendAllocationRegion` extends the region's end and handle
table. The new chunk is upper-owned and coalesces with eligible adjacent free
chunks. S(0) buffers can span physical mapping boundaries. S(1), including
alignment and padding, remains confined to the original allocation even when a
free span crosses P. A lower-end request never triggers growth.

BFC asks for its normal growth size first, then backpedals in whole mapping
granules. The floor is the amount needed to complete the region's free tail,
not the full request, so a request can succeed when physical memory is nearly
exhausted but a free tail only needs a small adjacent extension. Generic
suballocators that do not reserve VA retain separate-region growth: nonadjacent
allocations stay upper-owned and cannot coalesce, and an extension that was
sized for a tail but lands elsewhere is returned. Only an explicitly unsupported
reservation falls back to that path; actual CUDA reservation failures are
reported.

Allocation policy remains attached to the memory space: S(1) uses ascending
equal-size holes and exact splitting; S(0) uses descending equal-size holes and
the BFC heuristic for both holes and gap carves.

Ranks may grow independently. When optional automatic registration of ordinary
backing allocations is requested, the pool is pinned to a fixed fraction for
that client so the registered arena never grows; collective-window registration
continues to use the fixed S(1) range. Existing buffers never move or change backing. Each
physical handle is retained until its mapping is unmapped at teardown, after the
device has been synchronized, then the VA reservation is released.

## Headroom and host run-ahead

Without growth, a default-memory miss enters the allocator retry path and waits
up to about ten seconds for in-flight frees, which throttles a host thread that
has run ahead of the device. With growth, the miss maps more physical memory
immediately, so run-ahead can inflate the mapped prefix. Freed buffers return to
BFC, but their backing stays mapped until teardown (`garbage_collection=false`).
Memory consumed this way is not available to cuDNN or NCCL workspaces, CUDA graph
instantiation, or other processes sharing the GPU. Use a capped policy such as
`0.75-0.85` to leave headroom, or a fixed one such as `0.75-0.75` to restore the
fixed-pool back-pressure.

Growth adds no headroom or future collective-gap reservation. Live S(0)
buffers can still occupy initial capacity needed by a later S(1) request.
Freed buffers return to BFC; backing allocations remain until destruction.
The PjRt cross-host fabric descriptor carries one physical handle, so exporting
an S(0) buffer spanning mappings returns an explicit unsupported-transfer error.
Representing multiple handles in that protocol is a separate extension.
